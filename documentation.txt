C++ Numerical Analysis methods

This directory contains numerical methods introduced on the course MS-C1650. They are also tested and errors
are computed. Each file also contains more documentation for it's functions. 

The layout of the directory:

main.cpp - this file is used to choose test parameters and to run tests using error functions

/src/ - folder containing all other necessary files


/src/functions.h - header file containing the definitions of all numerical method functions, which are:

/src/arctanx.cpp - contains a function that returns the value of pi it uses, and another function
which is an approximation for arctanx

/src/lagrange.cpp - contains all the necessary functions to construct and compute the barycentric
form of Lagrange interpolation

/src/quadhermite.cpp - contains a function which gives the coefficients for quadratic Hermite interpolation
and a function that contructs the Bernstein polynomials and the final interpolation polynomial

/src/montecarlo.cpp - contains a function which returns the Monte Carlo approximation of the ratio between
a unit ball's volume and a unit cube's volume

/src/heun.cpp - contains a function that forms the time vector based on the endpoints and n, also contains
a function implementing Heun's method on a given derivative function and initial value

/src/fd.ccp - contains 3 functions to present a differential equation for Euler or Heun's method, one returns the 
errorless initial value, one returns the derivative and one returns the analytical solution which is used
for testing error


/src/errors.h - header file containing functions for computing the errors of the methods

/src/errors.cpp - contains error functions for each method
